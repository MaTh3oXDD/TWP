# Distributed Programming

Information and Communication Technology has provided society with a vast diversity of distributed applications. By design, the deployment of this kind of application has to focus primarily on communication. Examples collected in the `DistributedProgramming` solution addresses the systematic approach to the designing of the meaningful Machine to Machine (M2M) communication targeting distributed mobile applications in the context of new emerging disciplines, namely Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) atop of the M2M communication and composed as multi-vendor cyber-physicals systems.

This folder collects examples that can serve as a certain pattern with the broadest possible applicability addressing the applications in concern.
